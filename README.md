# DecentSampler-schema

XML schema for [DecentSampler](https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/) preset (`.dspreset`) files.

Making virtual instruments for DecentSampler eventually means some tedious editing of the XML-based `.dspreset` files by hand.
If your text editor supports XML schemas, you can **super-charge your editing experience**!

This schema was kickstarted with [XML by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml). Generating a schema from an existing file is a very cool feature!
